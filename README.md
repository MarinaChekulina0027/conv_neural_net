# conv_neural_net

#Comments:

Unfortunately, I can't upload checkpony_dir with all files, because one of the files is too large for git. So if you want to assemble the project, you have to change paths in this code in conv_neural_net on your paths or make "short" paths. There are 1000 steps in cycle for learning, but you can change this number. It's a middle size for steps, when you computer works normal and this doesn't require so much time. Fisrt time the app will create a file for this model, where data will be stored. Second time will restore data from this file, so you haven't to train system if accuracy is enough for you, so you can change a number in cycle on 0 (now it is 1000 steps) or you can train system several times more and accuracy will increase.
